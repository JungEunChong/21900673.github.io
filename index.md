## JungEunChong's page ##

Hi! My name is JungEunChong.

I'm [Handong Global University](https://www.handong.edu/) student.

My major is [School Of Computer Science And Electrical Engineering](http://csee.handong.edu/)

My first programming language is C.

In Handong, I exercise 'processing' first. That was very intuitive, interesting.
